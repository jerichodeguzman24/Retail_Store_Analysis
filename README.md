# Retail_Store_Analysis
This is an Explanatory Data Analysis about the USA retail stores, the aim of this analysis is to answer some business problems with the help of the data. This analysis helps to answer what is the Region, State or City with the lowest sales. Additionally, it tackles what product category is profitable and have a highest sales.

The analysis was conducted using Python programming language and various data wrangling and visualization libraries, such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly. The data was cleaned and preprocessed to remove missing values and outliers. Exploratory data analysis techniques were employed to identify patterns and trends in the data.

Please refer to my code for my insights and recommendations.

I chose this task to showcase my talent and skills in performing EDA using Python for my internship at The Sparks Foundation Data Science and Business Analytics program.
